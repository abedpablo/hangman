the world’s my oyster
don’t muddy the waters
a cast-iron stomach
don't beat a dead horse
blue in the face
ignorance is bliss
knee jerk reaction
a weight off my shoulders
my Achilles heel
cog in the machine
hold your horses
burning the midnight oil
upset the apple cart
a bird in the hand
a bite at the cherry
batten down the hatches
point of no return
shiver me timbers
tell it to the judge
beach volleyball tournament
camping in a recreational vehicle
deep sea fishing
dog days of summer
family camping adventure
floating on an air mattress
frequently apply sunscreen
fun in the sun
grilled burgers and hot dogs
going to the water park
hiking in the mountains
lazy days at the lake
lazy days of summer
movies under the stars
open fire cooking
prepare for hurricane season
run through the sprinklers
swimming pool safety
tend your backyard garden
take me out to the ballgame
