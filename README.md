# Hangman
Text based hangman game

## Welcome to Hangman!

The object of the game is simple, guess the word or phrase letter by letter before the drawing of
the man has been completed, 6 wrong guesses or until the entire word or phrase has been guessed
correctly. For instance the phrase "hello world" will appear as "----- -----". The player will
guess one letter and the program checks if the guessed character is in the hidden phrase. If "E"
is guessed the program will print "-e--- -----". 

When you first begin the program, you may choose the level of difficulty by an integer of 1 to
3 (1-Easy,2-Medium,3-Hard). Any special characters will be provided and displayed. The player
only guess alphabetic characters. Good luck and have fun!
